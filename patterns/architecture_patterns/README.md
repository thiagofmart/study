# Architecture Patterns
Architecture patterns also known as architectural patterns or software architecture patterns, are reusable, high-level solutions to common design problems that occur in software architecture. They provide a framework for addressing specific architectural concerns and help ensure that a system is scalable, maintainable, and reliable.

## Layered Patterns
### N-tier Architecture
Organizes components into separate layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access), promoting separation of concerns and modularity.
### Microkernel Architecture
Separates core functionality from plug-in modules, allowing the system to be easily extended and customized.

---
## Distributed Systems Patterns
### Client-Server Architecture
Divides the system into clients, which request services, and servers, which provide those services.
### Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
A decentralized system where each node can act as both a client and a server, and communication occurs directly between nodes.
### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
This pattern organizes a system as a collection of services that communicate through well-defined interfaces. These services can be reused and combined to form new applications or systems.

---
## Event-driven Patterns
### Event-Driven architecture
This pattern is based on the flow of events, where components communicate by exchanging events or messages. It's commonly used in systems with asynchronous processing or in situations where components need to react to external events.
### Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) architecture
In this pattern, components (publishers) publish messages to a central message broker or event bus, and other components (subscribers) subscribe to receive those messages. It promotes loose coupling and is often used in event-driven architectures and distributed systems.

---
## Modular Patterns
### Component-based architecture
Breaks the system into reusable, self-contained components with well-defined interfaces, promoting modularity and maintainability.
### Modular monolith architecture
Organizes the system into a single deployable unit composed of loosely-coupled modules, which can be developed and tested independently

---
## Domain-driven Patterns
### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Focuses on modeling the core business concepts and rules, and organizing the system around those domain models.
### Hexagonal architecture (Ports and Adapters)
Encapsulates business logic within a central core and defines interfaces (ports) to interact with external systems (adapters).

---
## Scalability and Availability Patterns
### Microservices architecture
This pattern decomposes a system into a collection of small independent, and loosely coupled services, autonomous services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
### Serveless architecture
Leverages cloud-based Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms to execute code in response to specific events, reducing operational overhead and enabling automatic scaling.



---
## Master-Slave Pattern
This pattern involves a master component that controls and coordinates one or more slave components, which perform the actual work. This pattern is often used in parallel computing and distributed systems.


## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
This pattern separates the system into three main components: the Model (managing data and business logic), the View (presenting data to the user), and the Controller (handling user input and updates). It's often used in user interface design and web applications.
## Caching Pattern
This pattern temporarily stores the results of expensive operations or frequently accessed data to reduce latency and improve performance. It can be applied at different levels of a system, such as in-memory caching, database caching, or web caching.

These architecture patterns are not mutually exclusive and can be combined to create a complex and robust solutions. The choice of patterns depends on the specific requirements, contrainst, and goals of the system being designed.
